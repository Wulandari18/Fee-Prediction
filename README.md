# Fee-Prediction

In 2020, I joined Bootcamp about Python-Data Science which is held by Sanbercode. In the last project, I try to predict employee fees using four model, i.e. Logistic Regression, 
Decision Tree Classifier (DTC), K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier (KNN), and Support Vector Classifier (SVC). 

To run the code we need the following packages:

NumPy
Pandas
Sklearn
Please contact me at wulanddarii18@gmail.com if any discussion about this code.

Enjoy it!
